# ECE-4305 Lab 1
## Some Notes
- I kept the entire Vivado folder intact just in case I want to download the whole project to open up.
- If you just want the designs and simulations, you can get them in the respective Simulations and Designs folder at the top level of this repo.

### Left and Right Shifter Separate (4'b1001)
In this test, I pass 4'b1001 as an input string to a left shifter and a right shifter.

### Left and Right Shifter Separate (8'b1000_0001)
In this test, I modify the testbench to instead pass 8'b1000_0001 as an input string to a left shifter and a right shifter.

### Multi Barrel Shifter - Mux and Reverser (4bXXXX)
In this test, I pass the same inputs to two multi-barrel shifters. One is implemented using a multiplexer, one is implemented using a reverser.
